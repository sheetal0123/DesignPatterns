# Object Hierarchy

Whenever we have a case when one object has many child and again child has many grand child
e.g. A Big Merchant has many Outlets in town and every outlet has many terminal machine for card swipe

So complete hierarchy will be stored in single merchant object which has all details of its outlet and further outlet's terminals
